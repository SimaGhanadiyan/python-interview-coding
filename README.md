# Python Interview Practice Coding

This repository contains a collection of Python coding exercises focused on interview preparation for data-related roles. The exercises are divided into three main sections: Python, NumPy, and Pandas. Each section covers fundamental concepts with hands-on practice, following a structured and progressive approach.

## üìö Sections Covered

### 1. Python Basics üêç
This section focuses on core programming concepts in Python and includes:

- **Statements**: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `pass`, `continue`, `break`
- **Object and Data Structures**: strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets
- **List Comprehensions** and conditional expressions
- **Functions and Methods**: defining and using functions, built-in methods, and basic logic
- Practice problems such as: FizzBuzz, word filtering, string manipulation, and more.

### 2. NumPy üí°
Focused on fast numerical operations using the NumPy library:

- **Array creation**: `np.array()`, `np.arange()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`
- **Indexing and slicing**
- **Aggregations and Statistics**: `mean`, `min`, `max`, `median`, `unique`, and more
- **Random Sampling** with `np.random`
- **Filtering and logic operations**

Assignments simulate real analysis such as:
- Extracting top values from price arrays
- Working with random subsets
- Labeling data based on statistical thresholds

---

### 3. Pandas üìä
Exploring and analyzing tabular datasets using Pandas:

- **Reading Data** with `pd.read_csv()`, skipping rows, loading sample data
- **Data Inspection**: `head()`, `shape`, `columns`, `dtypes`, `describe()`
- **Conversion to NumPy arrays**
- **Data Filtering**, sampling, and simple condition-based labeling

Final assignments combine Pandas with NumPy for practical tasks like:
- Filtering sales by product family
- Sampling subsets of data
- Calculating statistical metrics from real sales data
